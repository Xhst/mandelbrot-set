This project is a viewer for the Mandelbrot set, a particular two-dimensional set defined in the complex plane that exhibits internal homotety; it is therefore a fractal.

<h2>ðŸ”Ž About Mandelbrot Set</h2>

The **Mandelbrot Set** $\mathcal{M}$ is defined from a family of complex quadratic polynomials: 

$$f_c : \mathbb{C} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$$

in the form:

$$f_c(z) = z^2 + c$$

For each complex parameter $c$ we consider the behavior of the succession $(0, f_c(0), f_c(f_c(0)), \dots )$ obtained by iterating $f_c(z)$ from the point $z = 0$ this can either diverge to infinity or be limited.
The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of points $c$ such that the corresponding subsequence is limited. 
The previous succession can also be written as:

$$\begin{cases}z_0 = 0 \\
z_{n+1} = z^2 + c\end{cases}$$

if we indicate with $f^n_c(z)$ the $n$-th iteration of $f_c(z)$, $(f_c \circ f_c \circ \dots \circ f_c)(z)$ self composed $n$ times, the Mandelbrot Set is:

$$\mathcal{M} =  \\\{\ c \in \mathbb{C} : \sup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\ |f^n_c(z) < \infty \\}\ $$
